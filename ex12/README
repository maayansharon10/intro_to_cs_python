Description:
The basic game Four in a Row is using a main class: Game, which uses
classes Board and Player (has 2 classes which uses it in heritage: AiPlayer and
 HumanPlayer).
In order to deal with computer-based players, the class AI is providing the
"brain" for AiPlayer.
In order to run the game, class "Controller" is "connecting the dots": using
the game functions and adding some others which allow creating a whole flow of
the game.
For a visual display of the game, we created class Ui. Ui knows the controller,
 and "translates" the players choices into commands in the controller.

 The computer-player is using a recursive function which tries to predict good
 options for placing the disc. Note: This is not a Bonus costumed function.
