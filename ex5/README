Description:
wordsearch.py
in this ex we practices writing and using loops, multi-dalmatians
lists,
dictionaries, arguments form command line and working with files.
The aim of the ex is writing a program which finds words in a matrix of
letters (like a crossword) while program receive its arguments from command
line (file with word we wish to search, matrix of letter, output file and
directions for search)


check_wordsearch.py
test for a function that find_words_in_matrix calls.

******************************************************************************

*** wordsearch.py***

in my program we searched the first letter of every word in the list in the
matrix, and when we find a match, meaning we suspect we found thr first letter
of our word, we check if the next letter in the same direction also
matches the second letter in our word and so on, up until we have the full word
we searched. if so - we add it to a list. at the end the program gives us a
list of pairs (as tuples) with the word we found and number of time it
appeared for the directions we searched.


Separetion to function -
we have the main func which control the search(the program).
the other main functions are:
- check_input_args which uses sub funcs that
check if file exsist or if directions are valid.
- find_word_in_matrix that uses sub funcs to cound the number of times word
appears in matrix, append in dictionary and later appand it to a list of
tuples, which the func returns.
-write_output_file which add the new tuples in our result list to an output
file in the way we were instracted.


*** check_wordsearch.py ***
we checked the function that count the number of time the word appeared in all
the directions we checked.
i chose some extreme cases such as long dangle words, big matrix, a lot of
repetitions for one place, same direction appeases several times and a case
where there is a word of one letter.
