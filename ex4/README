README for ex4: Hangman Game.
============================================================================

============================================================================
Description:
in this ex we practices writing a whole program useing functions, loop,
external files and user other programs' functions (hangman_helper) in out
program.

hangman.py -
In this code i wrote a hangman game. the user needs to guess a random word the
program chooses for him. the program notifies when user picked an an valid
letter or a letter he had already chosen before. if the user made a mistake,
the program adds another line to the hangman drawing. if user maximised his
munber of errors he loses. if he guessed the word - he wins. in both cases
programs display a message to user.
check_update_word_pattern.py
check function update_word_pattern
****************Theoretical questions - ************************


***********************SECTION C - Q1:*************************

the test i wrote in file check update word pattern ment to check -

# in case all letters needed to be updated are the same one after the other

# in case several letters needed to be updated are the same are not
 next to each other
# in case the word is very long and the letter we need to update is the last
 one
# in case the letter is not in word and pattern should not be updated

***********************SECTION C - Q2:*************************
in order to play the game in hebrew i need to change the function
is_user_input_valid(string) since it checks is.lower, when in hebrew there are
no lower or upper cases. i would change the function to check if there are any
an valid letters (numbers, signs, etc) and made sure only the letter א-ב .
